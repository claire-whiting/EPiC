We are a team of researchers from the Department of Psychology and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton University.Our core team comprises four PhD students, Jamie Chiu, Dan Mircea, Henna Vartiainen, and Claire Whiting, who work in Niv Lab and Logic of Emotion Lab.  

Additionally, we have two advisory team members: Isabel Berwian, a postdoctoral researcher from Niv Lab, and Erik Nook, the director of Logic of Emotion Lab.

## Approach:

For each scenario, we used a slightly adapted version of an LSTM model. We used windows of 100ms prior to predict each valence and arousal rating. To build and refine our models and hyperparameters, we divided the training dataset into a partial training set and a validation set, with the exact split depending on the scenario. For instance, in Scenario 2, six subjects were used as validation in each fold. Following this, we trained the best model for each scenario using the full training dataset of that scenario, which is what we submitted in the codebooks.

Each scenario has a corresponding jupyter notebook uploaded. Each codebook begins with loading and pre-processing the data. A model is trained and saved per fold -- the models are also uploaded in the repository and loaded into the codebook at the end to generate the predicted values of valence and arousal. The predictions are saved into the cvs files in the results directory, as per instructions provided. The original naming and structure of directories are kept, e.g., `./results/scenario_2/fold_3/test/annotations/sub_0_vid_2.csv`.
